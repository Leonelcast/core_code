# core_code
## Tuesday
### 1. Watch this video about compilation and interpretation
### 2. Search and answer the question: Java language is compiled or interpreted?
- Java language is compiled
### 3. Create an algorithm to calculate the equivalent of your local currencty to USD
- First of all we need the exact price equivalent of Quetzales to 1 dollar, so right now the price of $1 is equivalent to Q7.72. if I need to get another number for example Q100 I need to divided into 7.72 and it would be $12.95
### 4. Anwser to the question: Why is pseudocode helpful?
- It´s really useful because it can help to define an idea because all that matters is comprehension so the important thing is that you must explain what you are thinking. We don´t even need to code, because we create our own rules, and also is a set of instructions that we can use later and made it into code. 

### 5. Read about Pseudocode here, you can also find some examples here
### 6. Create a pseudocode to calculate the aproximated age of a user base on the year they born, (you can define a variable with the actual year if you need it, like for example i could define Y <-- 2022)
- the user needs to enter the value of the year they were born in this case I was born in y = 1997.
  the next step is to get the current year in this case it will be x = 2022.
  so we need to make this operation x - y, so it is 2022 - 1997 = 25  

### 7. Read about flowcharts here
### 8. Answer to the question: Why are flowcharts important to us as developers?
- A flowchart is really important as a software developer because it can help us to describe a process of what our system should do and shouldn´t. One of the must important flowchart as a software developer is UML. We can use a flowchart for the following:
- Demonstrate how the code is organized.
- Visualize the execution of a code within a program.
- Show the structure of a website or application.
- Understand how users navigate a website or program.
### 9. Search about High-level languages and Low-level languages, you can start with this video
- High-level: they are easy for the humans to understand but it´s difficult for the computer. We can find here interpreted languages like: JS, Python and ruby. Also we find here compiled languages like Java, C and others.
- Low-level: they are easy for the computers to understando but difficult for the humans. Here we find programming languages like Assembler that it's really difficult for the humans to understand.
